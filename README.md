# Why Does This Law Firm Have So Many Fake Reviews and Offices?

Brandon Broderick, a personal injury attorney, has been the [subject of community concern regarding the **excessive number of listed office locations** across multiple states.](https://support.google.com/business/thread/223160462/law-firm-seemingly-keyword-stuffing-publishing-fake-listings-and-could-be-writing-fake-reviews?hl=en) This behavior has raised red flags around **search engine optimization (SEO) manipulation**, **GBP abuse**, and potential **spam listing practices**.



### Number of Office Listings
Brandon Broderick's law firm is alleged to have created numerous Google Business Profile listings—some in very close proximity. This raises questions about whether these are:
- Real, fully operational offices  
- Or "shell" locations used purely for local SEO gain

###  Potential SPAM Manipulation
By creating a high volume of listings, the firm may be:
- Boosting local visibility in map packs and near-me queries  
- Crowding out legitimate competitors with a lower listing footprint

## Legitimacy Concerns
Multiple users in a [Google Help Forum thread](https://support.google.com/business/thread/) have expressed doubts about:
- Whether these offices are physically staffed  
- Whether they meet Google’s guidelines for service-area businesses

### Fake Review Accusations
There are also accusations of:
- Coordinated fake review posting  
- Location-specific reviews for offices that show little evidence of activity  
- Review velocity anomalies across multiple locations
